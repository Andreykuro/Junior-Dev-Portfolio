# Junior-Dev-Portfolio
--Exclusive Portfolio for project based purposes for potential clients/employers--

Welcome to my Junior Developer Portfolio! This repository showcases projects that highlight my journey in software engineering, with a focus on software development fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and full-stack development. Here, you'll find work that demonstrates my skills in languages like Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, C, and C++, along with front-end development in HTML and CSS.

Each project in this portfolio aims to illustrate not just technical skills, but also my approach to solving problems, learning new concepts, and implementing industry best practices. Whether you're interested in well-commented code samples, sample applications, or seeing my progress as I advance my Junior Developer skill set, I hope this repository provides valuable insights!
